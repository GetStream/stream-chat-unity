## IL2CPP
SDK runs out of the box with IL2CPP

## WebGL
WebGL support is coming soon. It's currently available in Beta mode and will be released in early 2023 Q1. Reach out to us if you wish to test it.

## Free for Indie Developers

Stream is free for most side and hobby projects. You can use Stream Chat for free if you have less than five team members and no more than $10,000 in monthly revenue. Visit our website and [apply for the Makers Account](https://getstream.io/maker-account/).

## Getting Started

1. Download the [latest release .unitypackage](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-unity/releases/latest).
2. Launch Unity Editor and import the downloaded `.unitypackage`
3. Resolve [dependencies](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-unity#dependencies)
4. Start integrating Chat into your project! Check out the [Tutorial](https://getstream.io/chat/unity/tutorial/) to get yourself going.

## Sample Project

In the `StreamChat/SampleProject` you'll find a fully working chat example featuring:
- Browsing channels and messages
- Sending, Editing, Deleting a message
- Message right-click context menu
- Reactions
- Sending video attachments (works only in Editor)

It is created with Unity's uGUI UI system and supports both legacy and the new Unity's Input System. 

**How to run it?**
1. [Register](https://getstream.io/try-for-free/) an account and go to [Stream Dasboard](https://getstream.io/dashboard/)
2. Create App and go to its **Chat Explorer** throught the Dashboard
3. Create new chat user and save its **id**
4. Use our [online token generator](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/unity/tokens_and_authentication/?language=unity#manually-generating-tokens) to create user token
5. In Unity, provide: **Api Key**, **User Id** and **User Token** into `StreamChat/SampleProject/Config/DemoCredentials.asset`
6. Open `StreamChat/SampleProject/Scenes/ChatDemo.scene` and hit play

How to enable Unity's **[new Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/index.html)**?:
1. Make sure that the UnityEngine.InputSystem package is available in the project
2. Add **UnityEngine.InputSystem** dll reference to the **StreamChat.Unity** assembly definition asset

## Dependencies

- **TextMeshPro** StreamChat/SampleProject requires a TextMeshPro package
- **Newtonsoft.Json** SDK uses [Unity's package for Newtonsoft Json]([com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json@3.0](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json@3.0/manual/index.html)) Library for serialization.

:warning: In case you already have the Newtonsoft Json dll or package in your project and encounter the following error:<br>
`Multiple precompiled assemblies with the same name Newtonsoft.Json.dll included or the current platform. Only one assembly with the same name is allowed per platform.`
<br>you can remove the `StreamChat\Libs\Serialization\com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json@3.0.2` directory. Please note however, that Unity's package for Newtonsoft Json has IL2CPP support. If you wish to replace it and still use IL2CPP, make sure that the Json implementaion of your choice does support IL2CPP as well.
