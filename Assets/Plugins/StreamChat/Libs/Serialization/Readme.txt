Stream SDK uses Unity's fork of the Newtonsoft Json for serialization. This Json implementation works with IL2CPP

https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json@3.0/manual/index.html

If you're already referencing this package in Packages/manifest.json or using a different Json library in your project, you can go ahead and delete this one.
